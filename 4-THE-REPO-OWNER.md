# How should I adopt the file structure to my needs:

By initializing your repository the OSPO has generated some useful documents. Some of them are mandatory and must not be changed, some of them are mandatory, but should be attuned to your needs, and some of them are optional. Here is a description of the documents, their purposes, and what you may/should (not) do with them:

* **4-THE-REPO-OWNER.md**: this file.

* **codestyle/checkstyle.xml**: a description of how to write source code.
  - You may erase or replace this file in accordance with your needs.
  
-->>>> ERASE?

* **templates/fileheader.txt**: a template for initializing any new files.
  - Each file must contain an instantiated version of the fileheader.txt
  - You must adopt the copyright line to your reality.
  
-->>>> MAKE SURE HEADERS INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED DETAILS
